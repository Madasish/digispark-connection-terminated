## Digispark Connection Terminated
A small thing I wrote for the Digispark using DigisparkKeyboard that opens a notepad window and writes out the whole [connection terminated copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/kcd9qp/connection_terminated/)

## Setup
To set up the Digispark itself I suggest you follow these instructions:
http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting

After that you can just clone the repository or just [download it as a zip file](https://github.com/Madasish/digispark-connection-terminated.git), open the .ino file and then upload the script to the Digispark!
