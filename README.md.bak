## Digispark Connection Terminated
A small thing I wrote for the Digispark using DigisparkKeyboard that opens a notepad window and writes out the whole [connection terminated copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/kcd9qp/connection_terminated/)

## Setup
To set up the Digispark itself I suggest you follow these instructions:
http://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting
After that you can just clone the repository or just download it as a zip file, open the .ino file and then upload the script!
